Tic Tac Toe game in the browser built with Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

Inspired by TheOdinProject's Full Stack JavaScript curriculum where the challenge was to fit as much of the JavaScript logic inside of IIFEs and Modules.

Functionality includes:

- Customizing player names
- Playing against another player or against a CPU in easy/hard mode
- Playing another round or restarting a new game
- The gamescore is tallied after every round or reset for every new game
- Custom animations when it's a new player's turn
- Popup screen to display when the game ends. 
- A rules button that displays how to play the game
